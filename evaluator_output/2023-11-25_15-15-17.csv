"Q: Is it true that there are two kinds of people serving as deputies of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, as members of the Supreme Court, and as Soviet diplomats? A: Yes, it is true. One kind is those not capable of anything at all, and the other is those capable of anything whatsoever.",64,3,2,"The joke plays on the perceived range of competency and morality within Soviet officialdom, framing the two extremes in a way that highlights the perceived lack of integrity or capability. It's a subtle dig at government inefficiency and corruption",5,4,5
"Q: Why do we need two central newspapers, Pravda (Truth) and Izvestiya (News) if both are organs of the same Party? A: Because in Pravda there is no news, and in Izvestiya there is no truth.",54,3,3,"This joke makes clever use of the literal meanings of the newspapers' names to satirize state-controlled media under the Soviet regime, highlighting the lack of reliable information and the propaganda in official publications",5,5,4

A: Yes, and the US Constitution also guarantees freedom after speech.",36,3,3,"This joke highlights the contrast between the theoretical rights offered by the Soviet system and the actual civil liberties experienced under it.

The previous broadcaster, while reading an article that contained the words, ""Socialism is nothing as compared with communism,"" made a pause too long after the word ""nothing.""",59,2,3,"This joke is funny because it plays on the culture of fear and censorship in the Soviet Union, where even a small mistake or misinterpretation in a public forum like broadcasting could be considered subversive or a political statement",4,3,4

If the Chinese communist Party ordered, their people just would step on each other's shoulders, and this way they could reach even the sun.",49,2,2,"This joke relies on exaggerating the large population and the obedience to authority in Communist China for a hyperbolic and amusing effect.

"Q: Why do some people say that Hungarians love the Russians and hate the Americans? A: Because Russians helped Hungarians to get rid of one totalitarian rule, but Americans didn't help to get rid of the other.",45,2,2,"This joke plays on historical events and the perspective that Russia (as part of the Soviet Union) 'liberated' Hungary from Nazi occupation only to impose its own Communist rule.

"Q: Are the bedbugs also builders of socialism? A: Of course, in their veins flows the workers-and-peasants' blood.",29,2,2,"This joke pokes fun at the socialist ethos of everyone contributing to the state by implying even pests like bedbugs are part of the system, as they feed off the blood of the common workers and peasants.

"Q: Why Lenin wore regular shoes, but Stalin wore boots? A: At Lenin's time, Russia was still only ankle-high in shit.",29,2,3,This joke harshly satirizes the progression of Soviet leadership and implies a metaphorical deepening of troubles from Lenin's era to Stalin's.

Q: is it possible to solve a problem which has no solution? A: We don't answer questions related to agriculture.,25,2,2,"The joke subtly pokes fun at the bureaucratic and often non-sensical responses from Soviet officials when trying to avoid difficult or sensitive questions, especially during times when agriculture was a troubled sector with many problems deemed ""unsolvable"" by the authorities",3,2,4
Q: Why the answers of Armenian Radio are often stupid? A: Because these answers are invented not by Armenians.,24,2,1,"This joke plays on the stereotype of the Armenian Radio jokes, where the humor is usually derived not from the intelligence of the Armenian people, but rather from the witty or satirical nature of the responses.

A: On other planets, there is also no life.",21,2,1,"This joke plays on the Soviet-era trope that anything which is scarce or non-existent in Soviet life is similarly scarce or non-existent elsewhere, even extraterrestrially; however, it might be seen as more of a bleak comment than a joke with a punchline",4,3,4

Q: What is chaos? A: We do not comment on national economics.,16,2,2,"This joke is quite funny because it cleverly critiques the state of the economy by equating it with chaos, implying that the economic system is so disordered that it could be considered ""national chaos."" The humor also comes from the evasion of a direct answer, which is a subtle dig at political avoidance of difficult topics",4,3,4

The humor is not particularly sharp or deeply satirical",2,2,2
