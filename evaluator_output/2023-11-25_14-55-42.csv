One kind is those not capable of anything at all, and the other is those capable of anything whatsoever.",64,3,2,"This joke highlights the perception of incompetence and unscrupulousness among Soviet officials, offering a cynical view of their abilities and moral flexibility. It’s a simple play on words with a touch of political satire",5,4,5
"Q: Why do we need two central newspapers, Pravda (Truth) and Izvestiya (News) if both are organs of the same Party? A: Because in Pravda there is no news, and in Izvestiya there is no truth.",54,3,3,"This joke cleverly plays on the meanings of the newspapers' names in Russian and the commonly perceived lack of credibility and freedom of the press in the Soviet Union, hinting at the propaganda and censorship practices of the time. The wordplay here is intelligent and humorously points out the absurdity of state-controlled media",5,5,4

The joke is cleverly structured to reveal the punchline, which is both ironic and sad, reflecting the reality of the time",4,3,4

If the Chinese communist Party ordered, their people just would step on each other's shoulders, and this way they could reach even the sun.",49,2,2,"This joke relies on an exaggerated portrayal of the Chinese ability to mobilize its massive population towards a collective task, poking fun at the obedience of people under a communist regime",3,3,2

A: Because Russians helped Hungarians to get rid of one totalitarian rule, but Americans didn't help to get rid of the other.",45,2,2,"This joke is somewhat funny, as it is based on historical context and plays on the irony of liberation and occupation. It conveys the complex sentiment some Hungarians might have felt towards their ""liberators"" who ended one form of oppression only to replace it with another.

A: At Lenin's time, Russia was still only ankle-high in shit.",29,2,2,"This joke makes a satirical comparison between the times of Lenin and Stalin, using hyperbole to emphasize the deepening of problems or oppression in the Soviet era.

A: We don't answer questions related to agriculture.,25,2,2,"This joke relies on the knowledge of the Soviet era and its constant struggles and failures in agriculture, despite numerous plans and efforts to improve it.

It's somewhat esoteric, so might not land well with all audiences",3,2,4
Q: Why the answers of Armenian Radio are often stupid?

Q: What is cosmopolitan? A: Cosmonaut's deputy in political affairs.,18,1,1,"This joke plays on the similarity between the words ""cosmopolitan"" and ""cosmonaut,"" suggesting a humorous yet nonsensical job position, which might be a subtle way to make fun of Soviet-era political positions that were numerous and sometimes absurd.
