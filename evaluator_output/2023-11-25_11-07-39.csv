"Q: Is it true that there are two kinds of people serving as deputies of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, as members of the Supreme Court, and as Soviet diplomats? A: Yes, it is true. One kind is those not capable of anything at all, and the other is those capable of anything whatsoever.",64,3,2,The joke reflects the cynicism and distrust in the capabilities and morality of the Soviet political and legal systems by categorizing officials into either utterly incompetent or unscrupulously opportunistic. The contrast is humorous because it plays on the extremes without a middle ground. ,5,4,5
"Q: Why do we need two central newspapers, Pravda (Truth) and Izvestiya (News) if both are organs of the same Party? A: Because in Pravda there is no news, and in Izvestiya there is no truth.",54,3,3,"This joke is clever as it plays on the ironic meaning of the names of the two newspapers and the reality of state-controlled media in the Soviet Union, highlighting the lack of true news in the ""News"" paper and the absence of truth in the ""Truth"" paper. It uses wordplay and irony effectively.",5,5,4
"Q: What is the difference between the Constitutions of the USA and USSR? Both guarantee freedom of speech. A: Yes, and the US Constitution also guarantees freedom after speech.",36,3,3,"This joke plays on the contrast between the theoretical rights offered in the USSR and the actual lack thereof once exercised, which is a clever and pointed observation of political realities. It draws humor from the ironic twist that implies real consequences for exercising free speech in the USSR. ",5,5,4
"Q: Can a son of a General become a Marshal? A: No, because every Marshal also has a son.",24,3,2,"The joke plays on the nepotism and hierarchy in the Soviet military structure, implying that positions are inherited rather than earned.

"Q: Why did you not broadcast for such a long time? A: We had to make some changes to our staff. The previous broadcaster, while reading an article that contained the words, ""Socialism is nothing as compared with communism,"" made a pause too long after the word ""nothing.""",59,2,3,"This joke is humorous because it hints at the oppressive nature of censorship in Soviet times, where even a slight misinterpretation or pause in speech could lead to grave consequences for the speaker. It also plays on the sensitivity surrounding the ideology and the fears associated with it.",4,3,4
"Q: Does China have rockets powerful enough to reach the moon? A: They don't need rockets. If the Chinese communist Party ordered, their people just would step on each other's shoulders, and this way they could reach even the sun.",49,2,2,"This joke plays on the stereotypical view of China's large population and the strong control exerted by the Communist Party, with an exaggerated and humorous image of people stacking up to reach celestial bodies. It could be seen as funny due to the absurdity of the imagery.",3,3,2
"Q: Why do some people say that Hungarians love the Russians and hate the Americans? A: Because Russians helped Hungarians to get rid of one totalitarian rule, but Americans didn't help to get rid of the other.",45,2,2,"The joke makes a satirical comment on the historical context of Soviet influence in Hungary, ironically insinuating that the Russians provided aid, but in a way that simply shifted the type of oppressive regime rather than leading to true freedom.

A: Yes, it's true, but on the other hand the Soviet-made transistors are the largest in the world.",43,2,2,"This joke plays on the contrast between American and Soviet achievements, poking fun at the unintended inefficiencies or shortcomings of Soviet technology.

"Q: Are the bedbugs also builders of socialism? A: Of course, in their veins flows the workers-and-peasants' blood.",29,2,2,"This joke uses dark humor by suggesting that even the bedbugs participate in building socialism, a reference that mocks the idea of everyone contributing to the collective good in a socialist state.

A: At Lenin's time, Russia was still only ankle-high in shit.",29,2,2,"This joke uses dark humor and historical perspective to make a satirical point about the deepening problems of Russia at different points in its history, comparing the severity of issues during Lenin's and Stalin's times through the metaphor of shoes and boots representing the depth of troubles.",3,4,2
"Q: When the elections were first held using the Soviet method? A: When Adam was electing his wife, and Eve her husband.",28,2,2,"The joke is a playful take on the idea that Soviet-style ""elections,"" widely perceived as lacking genuine choice, predates recorded history and hints that even the biblical figures had no real choice.

"Q: What is the easiest way to explain the meaning of the word ""communism?"" A: By means of fists.",26,2,2,"The joke implies that the explanation of communism comes through force or violence, which is a dark play on the coercive methods sometimes associated with communist regimes.

A: It's possible, but who will we buy grain from?",25,2,2,"The joke relies on historical context, where the Soviet Union occasionally had to buy grain from capitalist countries due to its own agricultural shortcomings.

Therefore, it subtly criticizes the economic feasibility of the communist model using America as an example.",3,4,2
Q: is it possible to solve a problem which has no solution? A: We don't answer questions related to agriculture.,25,2,2,"The joke is a subtle dig at the inefficiencies and bureaucratic responses in the Soviet system, where questions about fundamental problems often received irrelevant or deflective answers.

A: Because these answers are invented not by Armenians.,24,2,2,"This joke plays on the meta-humor of the Armenian Radio jokes themselves, implying that the answers are ""stupid"" because they are not created by Armenians, thus attributing a cleverness to Armenians while simultaneously engaging in self-deprecating humor.",3,2,3

It's funny because it points to an undermining truth that communism, as practiced, did not eliminate disparities as promised. Rating: 2",3,2,3
"Q: Under communism will we still have money? A: No, none of that either.",19,2,1,"This joke plays on the often-propagated idea that Communism would create a moneyless society, implying an economic scarcity instead of an abundance that would remove the need for money. It's a dark form of humor that comments on the economic hardships experienced under Communist regimes, where shortages were common. However, due to the brevity and lack of an explicit punchline, it might not evoke a strong laugh.",3,1,5
Q: What is chaos? A: We do not comment on national economics.,16,2,2,"This joke plays on the double meaning of ""chaos"" to humorously criticize the state of the national economy, suggesting that it's so bad it could be described as chaotic, which could make it funny for those who appreciate political and economic humor.",4,3,4
"Q: In our factory's mess hall, the tea is not sweet at all, while the mess manager says he puts sugar according to the prescribed dose. What shall we do? A: Try to stir your tea counterclockwise rather than clockwise.",51,1,2,"The joke is mildly funny as it plays on the idea of the inefficiency and bureaucracy within the Soviet system.

Q: Are there men who do not cheat on their wives when they are on prolonged business trips? A: Of course. Soviet cosmonauts and American astronauts.,34,1,2,"This joke plays on the idea that fidelity can only be ensured by extreme circumstances, in this case, being literally out of this world. The humor arises from the absurdity of such a situation being a solution for infidelity. The joke also touches on the theme of space race camaraderie between Soviet cosmonauts and American astronauts, implying that in this respect, they are not so different.",2,1,3
"Q: What is Sholokhov writing now? A: A crime novel titled ""How I Received the Nobel Prize in Literature.""",28,1,2,The joke plays on the suspicion and the common belief that Mikhail Sholokhov's Nobel Prize in Literature was not deserved and that there was some untold story or even foul play behind it.

Q: Is it possible in a socialist country to end up under a train? A: Easier than on a train.,25,1,3,"This joke is funny because it plays on the stereotype of inefficiency and scarcity in socialist countries, particularly in public transportation.

Q: What is cosmopolitan? A: Cosmonaut's deputy in political affairs.,18,1,2,"This joke plays on the similarity between the words 'cosmopolitan' and 'cosmonaut,' combining political overtones with space exploration themes.

Q: What else is there in orlando besides disney? A: Baldwin Park.,18,0,1,"This joke is attempting to play on expectations by referencing the well-known attraction of Disney in Orlando and then juxtaposing it with Baldwin Park, a lesser-known location.
