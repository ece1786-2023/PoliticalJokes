"Q: Is it true that there are two kinds of people serving as deputies of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, as members of the Supreme Court, and as Soviet diplomats? A: Yes, it is true. One kind is those not capable of anything at all, and the other is those capable of anything whatsoever.",64,3,2,"This joke uses a play on words related to the competence and moral flexibility of Soviet officials, which can be humorous given the context of perceived corruption and inefficiency in Soviet bureaucracies. However, it relies on some degree of insider knowledge and may not have universal comedic appeal. Therefore, the rating is 2.",5,4,5
"Q: Why do we need two central newspapers, Pravda (Truth) and Izvestiya (News) if both are organs of the same Party? A: Because in Pravda there is no news, and in Izvestiya there is no truth.",54,3,3,"This joke is very funny because it cleverly uses wordplay on the names of the newspapers to criticize the lack of reliable information in Soviet-era media, reflecting the reality of propaganda and censorship, so the rating is 3.",5,5,4
"Q: What is the difference between the Constitutions of the USA and USSR? Both guarantee freedom of speech. A: Yes, and the US Constitution also guarantees freedom after speech.",36,3,3,"This joke highlights the difference in the freedom of expression between the US and the USSR through a clever play on words, which makes it funny and thought-provoking. So the rating is 3.",5,5,4
"Q: Can a son of a General become a Marshal? A: No, because every Marshal also has a son.",24,3,2,"This joke plays on the idea of nepotism and the notion that high-ranking positions are passed down through family connections, rather than individual merit. While it touches upon a real social issue, the humor might not be strong enough to resonate universally or provoke a hearty laugh. Thus, I would rate this joke as a 2, as it is moderately funny and carries an undertone of satire.",5,5,5
"Q: Why did you not broadcast for such a long time? A: We had to make some changes to our staff. The previous broadcaster, while reading an article that contained the words, ""Socialism is nothing as compared with communism,"" made a pause too long after the word ""nothing.""",59,2,3,"This joke plays on the theme of censorship and the extreme sensitivity of the Soviet regime to any criticism or even perceived criticism, making light of the seriousness with which ideological purity was policed. The humor comes from the absurdity of someone losing their job over a simple pause while speaking—an overreaction to an innocuous act that inadvertently suggests criticism of the regime. It is a clever joke that would be well understood and appreciated for its satirical take on freedom of speech in the Soviet Union, so the rating is 3.",4,3,4
"Q: Does China have rockets powerful enough to reach the moon? A: They don't need rockets. If the Chinese communist Party ordered, their people just would step on each other's shoulders, and this way they could reach even the sun.",49,2,2,"This joke attempts to mock the perceived authoritarianism and collective mindset in China, suggesting an absurdly comical degree of obedience to Party commands. It also exaggerates the size of China's population in a visual and humorous way. The joke does play on absurdities, but may also lean on cultural stereotypes, which could be seen as insensitive. Therefore, the rating is 2.",3,3,2
"Q: Why do some people say that Hungarians love the Russians and hate the Americans? A: Because Russians helped Hungarians to get rid of one totalitarian rule, but Americans didn't help to get rid of the other.",45,2,2,"This joke attempts to make a commentary on political history, suggesting that Hungarians should favor Russians over Americans because of the assistance in changing their political situation. However, the humor may not be immediate and requires a certain level of historical understanding, which could limit its comedic impact. The joke is also based on a somewhat grim historical context, which can affect its reception. Therefore, the rating is 2.",4,4,3
"Q: Is it true that American skyscrapers are the tallest in the world? A: Yes, it's true, but on the other hand the Soviet-made transistors are the largest in the world.",43,2,2,"This joke plays on the common idea of the technological rivalry during the Cold War, emphasizing the contrasting achievements of the US and Soviet Union, with a humorous twist on the stereotype of Soviet products being large and bulky compared to American ones. It has an element of humor, but it might not elicit a strong laugh from everyone since the humor is quite subtle and relies on an understanding of Cold War history, so the rating is 2.",4,3,4
"Q: Are the bedbugs also builders of socialism? A: Of course, in their veins flows the workers-and-peasants' blood.",29,2,2,"This joke uses irony by implying that the bedbugs, like good socialists, are 'contributing' to the society by feeding on the citizens, referencing the exploitation and hardships under the socialist regime. It’s a clever twist on the idea of everyone being a contributor to the socialist state. The rating is 2.",4,5,2
"Q: Why Lenin wore regular shoes, but Stalin wore boots? A: At Lenin's time, Russia was still only ankle-high in shit.",29,2,3,"This joke uses hyperbole and metaphor to satirize the state of Russia under different leaders, implying a worsening situation. It is a well-constructed comparison that delivers a punchline through historical context, so the rating is 3.",3,4,2
"Q: When the elections were first held using the Soviet method? A: When Adam was electing his wife, and Eve her husband.",28,2,1,"This joke attempts to draw a parallel between the biblical story of Adam and Eve and the concept of Soviet elections, known for the lack of choice and democratic process. However, the connection feels a bit forced and relies on a simplistic analogy which may not elicit a strong humorous response. Therefore, the rating is 1.",3,3,3
"Q: What is the easiest way to explain the meaning of the word ""communism?"" A: By means of fists.",26,2,2,"This joke uses an element of surprise because the punchline is unexpected and it comments on the oppressive tactics sometimes associated with communism, but it might be perceived as being in poor taste due to its allusion to violence. Therefore, the rating is 2.",4,5,2
"Q: Is it possible to build communism in America? A: It's possible, but who will we buy grain from?",25,2,2,"This joke plays on the historical context of the Soviet Union needing to import grain, often from the USA, despite its ambition to be a self-sufficient superpower and its ideological goal to spread communism. The humor lies in the ironic point that the spread of communism to the US would undermine the Soviet Union's own ability to sustain itself. The joke would be funnier if it had a more immediate punchline or if the context were more widely relatable. Therefore, the rating is 2.",3,4,2
Q: is it possible to solve a problem which has no solution? A: We don't answer questions related to agriculture.,25,2,2,"This joke is an example of subtle humor, as it hints at the bureaucratic and dismissive attitude that characterized government agencies during the Soviet era, where questions that could not be answered or were inconvenient would often receive unrelated or nonsensical replies. By likening an unsolvable problem to an ""agricultural question"", it suggests that discussing agricultural issues (a representation of broader systemic problems) was often avoided. The joke might not be universally understood without context, but for those familiar with the history, it's reasonably funny. Thus, the rating is 2.",3,2,4
Q: Why the answers of Armenian Radio are often stupid? A: Because these answers are invented not by Armenians.,24,2,2,"This joke plays on the stereotype of the ""wise fool"" and employs irony by suggesting the supposed stupidity showcased in Armenian Radio jokes is actually reflective of non-Armenians who create them. It has a self-aware and slightly self-deprecating element that can be appreciated. Hence, the rating is 2.",3,2,3
Q: What is the greatest achievement of Soviet agriculture? A: Sowing in the USSR and harvesting in America.,23,2,3,"This joke plays on the notorious inefficiency and failures of Soviet agriculture and the fact that despite the efforts, the actual benefits seem to occur elsewhere. It's a clever punchline that uses exaggeration to highlight a real historical issue, hence the humor is quite accessible. The rating for this joke is 3.",3,4,1
"Q: Is there life on other planets? A: On other planets, there is also no life.",21,2,1,"This joke attempts to play on the common speculative question about extraterrestrial life but subverts it by reflecting a sense of desolation or pessimism that could relate to the state of life under a certain political system, suggesting that life is equally lifeless elsewhere. This kind of dark humor might resonate with some, but its simplicity and lack of a punchy twist make it less impactful, so the rating is 1.",4,3,4
"Q: Will people have money when communism is built? A: Some will, some will not.",20,2,2,"This joke plays on the concept of an idealistic communist society where supposedly everyone is equal, yet it suggests there will still be disparities. It has a touch of irony that might bring a wry smile, but it's quite subtle and not a side-splitter. Therefore, the rating is 2.",3,2,3
"Q: Under communism will we still have money? A: No, none of that either.",19,2,1,"This joke plays with the common critique of communism where scarcity and the lack of goods are highlighted. It implies not only will communism abolish the concept of money but also suggests that there won't be anything to buy even if you had money. However, the delivery is quite straightforward and lacks an element of surprise or a clever twist, which might not elicit a strong laughter. So, the rating is 1.",3,1,5
Q: What is chaos? A: We do not comment on national economics.,16,2,3,"This joke plays on the double meaning of the word ""chaos,"" referring to both a state of disorder and, humorously, implying that the national economy is in such a state. The refusal to comment underscores the state's avoidance of addressing or acknowledging economic problems. The joke is witty and reflects on political and economic situations, so the rating is 3.",4,3,4
"Q: In our factory's mess hall, the tea is not sweet at all, while the mess manager says he puts sugar according to the prescribed dose. What shall we do? A: Try to stir your tea counterclockwise rather than clockwise.",51,1,2,"This joke plays on the idea of reversing conditions to achieve a different outcome, implying that following the party line even in mundane tasks like stirring tea might yield the sweet taste that's promised but not delivered. This could be a metaphorical commentary on broader political promises vs. reality in a command economy. It's clever but may not have a strong immediate comedic impact, so the rating is 2.",2,2,1
Q: Are there men who do not cheat on their wives when they are on prolonged business trips? A: Of course. Soviet cosmonauts and American astronauts.,34,1,2,"This joke plays on the literal distance aspect of being faithful due to astronauts and cosmonauts being physically far away from any temptation while in space. However, it delivers a more subtle punchline which might not resonate as universally funny, so the rating is 2.",2,1,3
"Q: What is Sholokhov writing now? A: A crime novel titled ""How I Received the Nobel Prize in Literature.""",28,1,2,"This joke pokes fun at the controversial topic of Sholokhov's Nobel Prize, hinting at the accusations that he did not write the work for which he was awarded. It's a clever play on the genre of crime and the mystery surrounding his award. However, the humor might not be apparent to those unfamiliar with Sholokhov or the controversy. Therefore, the rating is 2.",2,2,1
Q: Is it possible in a socialist country to end up under a train? A: Easier than on a train.,25,1,2,"This joke plays on the inefficiency and scarcity of transportation in a socialist system, contrasting the difficulty of securing travel with the alleged ease of meeting an accident. It capitalizes on irony and the grim humor of the situation, so the rating is 2.",2,2,2
Q: What is cosmopolitan? A: Cosmonaut's deputy in political affairs.,18,1,1,"The joke attempts to create humor by playing on the word ""cosmopolitan,"" linking it to the space theme through ""cosmonaut."" However, the punchline relies on a somewhat weak wordplay without a strong humorous twist or insightful commentary. Thus, it falls flat in terms of humor. The rating is 1.",2,2,2
