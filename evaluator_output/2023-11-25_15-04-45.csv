The previous broadcaster, while reading an article that contained the words, ""Socialism is nothing as compared with communism,"" made a pause too long after the word ""nothing.""",59,2,2,"This joke subtly criticizes the sensitivity and censorship within the Soviet-era media, where even a slight misstep such as an inappropriate pause could lead to severe consequences like losing one's job. It's amusing because it uses hyperbole to highlight the absurdity of the situation",4,3,4
"Q: Does China have rockets powerful enough to reach the moon? A: They don't need rockets.

A: Yes, it's true, but on the other hand the Soviet-made transistors are the largest in the world.",43,2,2,"This joke plays on the competition between the US and the USSR during the Cold War era to have the biggest and the best of everything, humorously twisting it by suggesting that in the Soviet Union, even the transistors were comically large, which is the opposite of what you would want in electronics",4,3,4

A: Of course, in their veins flows the workers-and-peasants' blood.",29,2,2,"This joke relies on word play and dark humor, combining the idea of bedbugs feeding on blood with the concept of socialism's ""workers-and-peasants,"" which provides a satirical commentary on the state of the common people in a socialist society",4,5,2

A: At Lenin's time, Russia was still only ankle-high in shit.",29,2,2,"This joke relies on a metaphor comparing the depth of problems in Russia during Lenin's and Stalin's times to the level of dirt one might walk through, thus necessitating different footwear.

A: It's possible, but who will we buy grain from?",25,2,3,"This joke effectively highlights the economic inconsistencies of the Soviet Union, which had to import grain from capitalist countries while promoting a communist ideology.

Q: is it possible to solve a problem which has no solution? A: We don't answer questions related to agriculture.,25,2,2,"The joke plays with the idea that in the Soviet Union, where agriculture was a persistent problem, questions without solutions were ironically related to agriculture.

However, the humor is somewhat niche and relies on a deeper understanding of Soviet history.",3,2,4
Q: Why the answers of Armenian Radio are often stupid? A: Because these answers are invented not by Armenians.,24,2,2,"This joke plays on the stereotype of Armenians being smart and implies that only when non-Armenians attempt to impersonate them, the answers turn out to be ridiculous",3,2,3

"Q: Under communism will we still have money? A: No, none of that either.",19,2,2,"This joke attempts to highlight the scarcity and privations under the communist system by suggesting that not only will certain goods and services be unavailable, but also that money, in a literal or figurative sense, will not exist due to the economic system's ineffectiveness. The comedic impact relies on the listener's understanding of these economic conditions",3,1,5

Q: Is it possible in a socialist country to end up under a train? A: Easier than on a train.,25,1,2,"This joke plays on the notorious inefficiencies and scarcities within a socialist system, particularly poking fun at the difficulty of getting a train seat due to poor public transport services, while darkly hinting it's easier to have an accident than to benefit from the system",2,2,2
Q: What is cosmopolitan? A: Cosmonaut's deputy in political affairs.,18,1,1,"The joke hinges on the similarity between the words ""cosmopolitan"" and ""cosmonaut,"" creatively misinterpreting the term ""cosmopolitan"" (which actually denotes a worldly person or view) as a political position related to space travel. It's a pun that takes a moment to process and while it's clever, it may not resonate with everyone or elicit a strong laugh.",2,2,2

Q: What else is there in orlando besides disney? A: Baldwin Park.,18,0,0,"This joke attempts to juxtapose the widely known attraction of Disney in Orlando with Baldwin Park, a lesser-known location.
