"Q: Is it true that there are two kinds of people serving as deputies of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, as members of the Supreme Court, and as Soviet diplomats? A: Yes, it is true. One kind is those not capable of anything at all, and the other is those capable of anything whatsoever.",64,3,2,"The joke is amusing because it plays on the dual meaning of being ""capable,"" implying that Soviet officials are either incompetent or unscrupulously flexible. It cleverly criticizes the quality and integrity of people in high positions in the Soviet system",5,4,5
"Q: Why do we need two central newspapers, Pravda (Truth) and Izvestiya (News) if both are organs of the same Party? A: Because in Pravda there is no news, and in Izvestiya there is no truth.",54,3,3,"This joke highlights the ironic reality of Soviet state-controlled media with a clever play on the names of the newspapers, leading to a humorous twist on the expected use of the words ""truth"" and ""news""",5,5,4
"Q: What is the difference between the Constitutions of the USA and USSR? Both guarantee freedom of speech. A: Yes, and the US Constitution also guarantees freedom after speech.",36,3,3,This joke is clever and delivers a poignant commentary on the difference between the freedoms allowed in the US versus the USSR. It humorously highlights the repression of free speech in the Soviet Union without being too obscure,5,5,4
"Q: Can a son of a General become a Marshal? A: No, because every Marshal also has a son.",24,3,2,"This joke plays on the nepotism and hierarchical structure of the Soviet military system, where rank could be influenced by personal relationships rather than merit.

"Q: Why did you not broadcast for such a long time? A: We had to make some changes to our staff. The previous broadcaster, while reading an article that contained the words, ""Socialism is nothing as compared with communism,"" made a pause too long after the word ""nothing.""",59,2,2,This joke is subtle but captures the paranoia and fear of misinterpretation in the Soviet era where even a simple pause could be viewed with suspicion. The humor is derived from the idea that such a small mistake could lead to such drastic measures as replacing a staff member,4,3,4
"Q: Does China have rockets powerful enough to reach the moon? A: They don't need rockets. If the Chinese communist Party ordered, their people just would step on each other's shoulders, and this way they could reach even the sun.",49,2,2,"This joke makes use of hyperbole to humorously exaggerate the notion of the vast population in China and the strict compliance of its citizens with the directives of the Chinese Communist Party. It's funny due to the surreal and whimsical imagery it invokes, illustrating how authority could lead to impossible feats.",3,3,2
"Q: Why do some people say that Hungarians love the Russians and hate the Americans? A: Because Russians helped Hungarians to get rid of one totalitarian rule, but Americans didn't help to get rid of the other.",45,2,2,"This joke has a dark sense of humor rooted in historical context – the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956 to suppress the revolution and the absence of American intervention. While it might evoke a wry smile due to its ironic twist on ""help,"" it can be seen as too cynical for some audiences, and its humor is contingent on a viewer's historical knowledge and perspective on international relations.",4,4,3
"Q: Is it true that American skyscrapers are the tallest in the world? A: Yes, it's true, but on the other hand the Soviet-made transistors are the largest in the world.",43,2,2,"This joke is somewhat funny as it plays on the competitive nature of the Cold War, touching on the Soviet penchant for large and often inefficient machinery compared to American technological advancements",4,3,4
"Q: Are the bedbugs also builders of socialism? A: Of course, in their veins flows the workers-and-peasants' blood.",29,2,2,"This joke has a dark humor element, playing on the concept of everyone contributing to the socialist society, even bedbugs, at the expense of the people. It's an indirect critique of the system sapping the life of its citizens.",4,5,2
"Q: Why Lenin wore regular shoes, but Stalin wore boots? A: At Lenin's time, Russia was still only ankle-high in shit.",29,2,2,"This joke makes a darkly humorous comparison about the state of Russia under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, with an implied critique on the worsening conditions or oppressive nature as time progressed",3,4,2
"Q: When the elections were first held using the Soviet method? A: When Adam was electing his wife, and Eve her husband.",28,2,2,"This joke leverages the historical narrative of Adam and Eve to humorously insinuate that in the Soviet electoral system there's no real choice, much like in the biblical story. However, the joke might require some cultural or historical understanding to fully appreciate the satire about the lack of choice in Soviet-style elections",3,3,3

A: By means of fists.",26,2,2,"This joke attempts humor by indirectly referencing the oppressive methods used by the Communist regime to enforce their ideology.

"Q: Is it possible to build communism in America? A: It's possible, but who will we buy grain from?",25,2,2,"This joke makes a humorous point about the historical reliance of the Soviet Union on purchasing grain from capitalist countries like the United States, despite ideological differences. It highlights the contradiction between communist self-sufficiency ideals and practical economic realities",3,4,2
Q: is it possible to solve a problem which has no solution? A: We don't answer questions related to agriculture.,25,2,2,This joke plays on the history of the Soviet Union's troubled agricultural policies and the state's dismissive or deflective responses to issues in that sector. The humor comes from the unexpected link between an abstract problem and a practical field like agriculture,3,2,4
Q: Why the answers of Armenian Radio are often stupid? A: Because these answers are invented not by Armenians.,24,2,1,"The joke attempts to be funny by implying that Armenians, known for their intelligence and wit, wouldn't come up with the silly answers attributed to ""Armenian Radio"", a popular Soviet-era joke format where the radio's responses are humorously inadequate or absurd. The humor also lies in national pride. However, it may not land well if the audience doesn't understand the stereotype or the historical context of the Armenian Radio jokes.",3,2,3
Q: What is the greatest achievement of Soviet agriculture? A: Sowing in the USSR and harvesting in America.,23,2,2,"This joke plays on the theme of failed agricultural policies in the Soviet Union by humorously suggesting that what was planted in the USSR had to be harvested in America, due to either poor yields or Soviet citizens emigrating. While it might reflect a critical historical truth, the humor may be seen as dated or requiring specific historical knowledge",3,4,1
"Q: Is there life on other planets? A: On other planets, there is also no life.",21,2,1,"This joke plays on the double meaning of ""life""—as in biological life and as in the quality/enjoyment of life. It also reflects the state of disenchantment and suggests that if life on Earth (especially under the oppressive regime) is bad, it is humorously presumed to be the same everywhere else. However, the punchline might be perceived as more cynical than funny to some",4,3,4
"Q: Will people have money when communism is built? A: Some will, some will not.",20,2,2,"This joke attempts to highlight the discrepancy between communist theory, which advocates for a classless and moneyless society, and the reality of wealth distribution even within communist systems. The humor is found in its cynicism and satirical take on the idealistic yet unachieved goals of communism",3,2,3
"Q: Under communism will we still have money? A: No, none of that either.",19,2,2,"This joke tries to lampoon the scarcity and economic difficulties under communist systems by implying that not only will certain freedoms or commodities be scarce, but even money itself will be non-existent, which is an exaggeration of real issues for comedic effect",3,1,5
Q: What is chaos? A: We do not comment on national economics.,16,2,3,"This joke cleverly uses the word ""chaos"" to simultaneously reference a state of extreme confusion and disorder and the economic conditions often criticized in Soviet or post-Soviet contexts. The humor comes from the evasion typical of Soviet-era officials when discussing sensitive issues",4,3,4
"Q: In our factory's mess hall, the tea is not sweet at all, while the mess manager says he puts sugar according to the prescribed dose. What shall we do?

It's a light humorous jab at the common issues workers faced",2,2,1
Q: Are there men who do not cheat on their wives when they are on prolonged business trips? A: Of course. Soviet cosmonauts and American astronauts.,34,1,2,"This joke manages to be funny due to its unexpected punchline that hinges on the literal interpretation of ""prolonged business trips"" being trips to space, which naturally preclude the possibility of infidelity.

A: A crime novel titled ""How I Received the Nobel Prize in Literature.""",28,1,2,"This joke plays on the suspicion and controversy surrounding Mikhail Sholokhov's Nobel Prize, hinting at some kind of wrongdoing or scandal associated with his award.

Q: What is cosmopolitan? A: Cosmonaut's deputy in political affairs.,18,1,2,"This joke plays on the word ""cosmopolitan,"" which can refer to someone familiar with and at ease in many different countries and cultures, but here, it is comically interpreted in a literal sense related to space (""cosmonaut"") while also hinting at the politicization of roles within the Soviet system. This wordplay is moderately clever",2,2,2

Q: What else is there in orlando besides disney? A: Baldwin Park.,18,0,0,"This doesn't seem to be a political joke or contain humor related to Russian or Soviet politics. Instead, it references a location in Orlando, Florida. This kind of joke may lack humorous elements and specific cultural or political context for a Russian political joke. Therefore, it does not qualify for a rating on the intended scale.

This comment lacks humor, especially in the context of Russian political jokes",0,0,0
