      "<user>: '''Q: Could an atomic bomb destroy our beloved town, Yerevan, with its splendid buildings and beautiful gardens? A: In principle, yes. But Moscow is by far a more beautiful city.'''\n",

      "<user>: '''Q: Is there a difference between capitalism and communism? A: In principle, yes. In capitalism, man exploits man. In communism, it's the reverse.'''\n",

      "Rating: 2\n",
      "Explanation: This joke is pretty funny because it plays on the stereotype of bureaucrats being either completely inept or alternatively very flexible in their principles, especially in the context of a one-party state like the USSR where political positions were often criticized for either incompetence or ruthlessness\n",
      "Rating: 3\n",
      "Explanation: This joke is quite funny as it sarcastically critiques the propaganda and censorship of the Soviet media by playing with the meaning of the names of the two major newspapers\n",
      "Rating: 3\n",
      "Explanation: This joke is funny because it pokes fun at the difference between the theoretical rights and the actual practice of those rights in the USSR compared to the USA, highlighting the lack of true freedom in the Soviet regime\n",
      "Rating: 2\n",
      "Explanation: This joke is moderately funny because it subtly plays on the theme of nepotism and the perpetuation of power within a closed system, implying that positions are inherited rather than earned - a critique that can be extended to many hierarchical organizations beyond just the military\n",
      "Rating: 2\n",
      "Explanation: This joke is subtly funny because it reflects the strict censorship and the consequences of not adhering to the party line in the Soviet Union. A simple pause could be interpreted as dissent\n",
      "Rating: 2\n",
      "Explanation: This joke is moderately funny because it employs hyperbole to jest about the large population of China and the control of the Communist Party over its people. It also touches on the theme of authoritarian governments expecting or claiming implausible achievements from their citizens\n",
      "Rating: 1\n",
      "Explanation: This joke relies on a nuanced understanding of Hungary's political history, particularly surrounding the periods of Nazi and Soviet occupations, playing on the notion of 'help' by contrasting the roles of the Russians and Americans. It might be appreciated by someone knowledgeable in European history, but for a broader audience, it might fall flat due to its complexity and the grim historical context\n",
      "Rating: 3\n",
      "Explanation: This joke is quite funny because it humorously contrasts the perception of American achievements with Soviet ones, essentially poking fun at the notion that Soviet technology was often seen as oversized and less advanced\n",
      "Rating: 2\n",
      "Explanation: This joke is moderately funny as it uses an unexpected comparison and irony to criticize the Soviet system, suggesting that even pests benefit from the blood, sweat, and toil of the working class.\n",
      "Rating: 3\n",
      "Explanation: This joke is funny because it makes a dark satirical commentary on the progression of conditions in Russia from Lenin's to Stalin's time, implying a worsening situation metaphorically represented by the depth of \"shit,\" thus necessitating boots for Stalin\n",
      "Rating: 3\n",
      "Explanation: This joke references the lack of real electoral choice in Soviet times by comparing it to the biblical story of Adam and Eve, where there was obviously no choice to be had -- a satirical take on predetermined electoral outcomes.\n",
      "Rating: 2\n",
      "Explanation: This joke plays on the idea that the theory and practice of communism are often seen as incongruent, and implies that force or coercion was commonly used to enforce its principles, thus it has a dark humor element reflecting historical realities\n",
      "Rating: 3\n",
      "Explanation: This joke is funny because it alludes to historical instances when the Soviet Union had to import grain from the capitalist United States, thereby highlighting the irony and practical contradictions in the pursuit of communism\n",
      "Rating: 3\n",
      "Explanation: This joke is funny as it takes a common saying that has philosophical undertones and redirects it to a jab at the often impractical and avoidant bureaucratic responses typical for the Soviet era, particularly in the context of agriculture, which was notoriously mismanaged\n",
      "Rating: 1\n",
      "Explanation: This joke plays on the stereotype of high intelligence or cleverness often attributed to Armenians by turning the premise of the \"Armenian Radio\" jokes on its head. It suggests that since the answers sound stupid, they couldn't possibly have been made by Armenians. This adds a layer of ethnic pride and self-flattery which, although could be seen as humorous to some, might not be universally received well due to its reliance on ethnic stereotypes.\n",
      "Rating: 3\n",
      "Explanation: This joke is funny because it critiques the inefficiency of Soviet agriculture through exaggeration, implying that the Soviet Union was unable to reap the benefits of its own agricultural labor, which somehow ended up benefiting the United States (a capitalist country) instead. It's witty in showing the absurdity of a system where the fruits of labor are not seen by those who work it\n",
      "Rating: 1\n",
      "Explanation: This joke hints at the Soviet-era denial and propagandistic approach to unfavorable situations by sarcastically implying that life under the Soviet system is so bad that even extraterrestrial beings would share the same 'no life' condition. However, the humor may be considered dry and somewhat subtle.\n",
      "Rating: 1\n",
      "Explanation: This joke plays on the disparities and perceived hypocrisies within the communist system, suggesting that even under the ideal scenario there would be unequal distribution of resources. It’s a subtle commentary on the nature of communism in practice versus its theory but may not elicit a strong laugh as it's quite dry\n",
      "Rating: 3\n",
      "Explanation: This joke plays on the ideological perspective of communism where the state is supposed to wither away and money would become obsolete as resources are shared. It's funny because it twists the ideal notion of ‘no need for money due to abundance’ into ‘no money because there’s nothing to buy,’ reflecting on the shortages and economic struggles in the Soviet era\n",
      "Rating: 3\n",
      "Explanation: This joke is funny because it cleverly satirizes how governments, particularly the former Soviet government, might evade talking about their economic struggles by dismissing the topic entirely\n",
      "Rating: 2\n",
      "Explanation: This joke is mildly funny because it satirizes the inefficiency and nonsensical practices that were often associated with Soviet-era institutions, suggesting that a mundane action such as stirring tea in a different direction might solve a systemic issue\n",
      "Rating: 2\n",
      "Explanation: This joke is moderately funny as it plays on the fidelity stereotype of men on long trips, but then uses the unique professions of cosmonauts and astronauts who physically can't cheat due to being in space – a clever and unexpected twist\n",
      "Rating: 2\n",
      "Explanation: This joke pokes fun at the idea that Sholokhov's Nobel Prize may have been awarded for reasons other than the literary merit of his work, implying some kind of wrongdoing or scandal behind it. This can resonate with audiences aware of controversies surrounding awards\n",
      "Rating: 3\n",
      "Explanation: This joke pokes fun at the inefficiencies of public transport or the lack of availability in a socialist system, which is both ironic and relatable to those familiar with the context\n",
      "Rating: 1\n",
      "Explanation: This joke tries to be funny through a play on words associating \"cosmopolitan\" with \"cosmonaut\", but the reference to a political deputy is a bit too far-fetched and obscure to deliver an immediate laugh, especially for those unfamiliar with Soviet-era terminology and humor\n",
      "Rating: 0\n",
      "Explanation: This is a factual statement providing historical information rather than a joke, so there's no comedic aspect to evaluate\n",
      "Rating: 0\n",
      "Explanation: This is a historical fact and not a joke\n",
      "Rating: 0\n",
      "Explanation: This is a factual statement rather than a joke, it lacks humor, surprise, or irony\n",
      "Rating: 0\n",
      "Explanation: This seems to be an attempt at humor through minimization by contrasting the internationally renowned attraction of Disney with a much lesser-known location, suggesting that there is nothing else of comparable significance. However, the joke is too vague and lacks a punchline or context that would make it funny in a satirical or absurd way\n",
